-- PURGED: Remove hardcoded upgrade seed data. JSON-first architecture owns upgrade definitions.
-- If you need initial content, use game-data/upgrades/*.json via FileStorage.

-- Legacy upgrade inserts have been removed intentionally.
-- Keep only non-content essentials (e.g., extensions, helper functions) here.
