Debugger System Summary & Integration Guide
==============================================

This Debugger system is a modular, command-driven plugin architecture designed for managing diverse server-side modules such as Database, Characters, AIChat, Gameplay, etc., in a structured and extensible way.

==============================================
Core Concepts
==============================================


1. DebuggerCore (The Orchestrator)
==============================================

Central managing unit of all registered plugins

Maintains a sequence-ordered registry of plugins

Provides lifecycle management methods

initAll() – Initialize every registered plugin sequentially

runCommand(command, data) – Broadcast a command to every plugin in order

stopAll() – Stop all plugins cleanly

Handles centralized, color-coded logging with timestamps for debugging and audit

Ensures fail-safe execution, catching errors per plugin without stopping the entire flow


2. DebuggerPlugin (Base Plugin Contract)
==============================================

Abstract base class/interface that every plugin extends

Plugins must implement 3 core async methods:

init(core) — Set up and prepare the plugin (e.g., load resources, connect databases)

run(command, data) — Receive runtime commands; decide whether to process or ignore

stop() — Graceful shutdown and cleanup (close connections, save state)

Guarantees uniform plugin behavior and predictable lifecycle handling

3. Plugins (Modular Functional Units)
Each plugin handles a specific domain, isolating responsibilities:


Plugin Name	Responsibility Description
==============================================

DatabasePlugin	Manage database connections, persistence, migrations
CharactersPlugin	Character creation, updates, stats management
AIChatPlugin	AI dialogue, mood, personality handling
GameplayPlugin	Game loops, quests, rewards, core gameplay mechanics
Plugins respond only to commands relevant to them (via run()).

Ignored commands don’t affect plugin or core stability.

They can be developed and tested independently.


4. DebuggerAssist (Optional Extension)
==============================================

Hook to add helper utilities, such as:

Automated error reporting

Plugin health monitoring

Dependency checking

Hot-loading/dynamic plugin injection


How to Register and Integrate Plugins
==============================================

Step-by-Step Integration

1. Create plugin class extending DebuggerPlugin

2. Create a new file in /modules folder, e.g. myplugin.js

3. Import DebuggerPlugin base class

4. Implement init(), run(), stop() as async functions

{js}
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
const DebuggerPlugin = require('../DebuggerPlugin');

class MyPlugin extends DebuggerPlugin {
  constructor() {
    super('MyPlugin');
  }
  async init(core) {
    // plugin setup here
  }
  async run(command, data) {
    // handle commands here
  }
  async stop() {
    // cleanup tasks here
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬

==============================================
Register your plugin with DebuggerCore

==============================================

In your main orchestration or startup file:


{js} 
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
const DebuggerCore = require('./DebuggerCore');
const MyPlugin = require('./modules/myplugin');

const core = new DebuggerCore();

// Register plugins in sequence order for predictable execution
core.register(new MyPlugin());
// Register other plugins similarly

(async () => {
  await core.initAll();

  // Run commands as needed
  await core.runCommand('exampleCommand', { key: 'value' });

  // Stop all modules on shutdown
  await core.stopAll();
})();
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬

Best Practices & Tips for Plugin Development

==============================================

Keep each plugin single-responsibility: One focused domain per plugin improves maintainability and testing.

Commands should be idempotent and safe: Repeated or out-of-sequence commands shouldn’t corrupt plugin state.

Use consistent plugin naming: Helps in logs and debugging.

Always catch and log errors inside plugin methods: Avoid plugin failure crashing the core or other plugins.

Support optional plugin info: Plugins can log additional info messages using Yellow level for awareness without alarming.

Write clear and comprehensive docs: If multiple agents (humans or AI) will develop plugins, well-commented code and usage docs save time.

Avoid direct core state mutation: Only interact with core through provided APIs or lifecycle hooks for modularity.

Leverage DebuggerAssist.js for common utilities: Use it to offload cross-cutting concerns and keep plugins simple.Implement command handling inside run()

==============================================

Use a switch-case or if-else to handle specific commands meant for your plugin:


{js} 
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬
async run(command, data) {
  switch (command) {
    case 'exampleCommand':
      // process data
      break;
    // add other commands
    default:
      // ignore unrelated commands
      break;
  }
}
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬

==============================================
Use core-provided logging

==============================================

Use core’s logging system for status reporting inside init, run, stop:

js
await core.log(`[Green] ${this.name} started command: ${command}`, 'success');

Example Plugin Workflow in Logs

==============================================

[Green] Database connected
[Green] Characters system ready
[Yellow] AIChat module initialized
[Green] Gameplay systems initialized

[Green] Added character: Bubby
[Green] Leveled up Bubby to 2
[Yellow] Responding to: Hello AI!
[Green] Starting game loop

[Green] Gameplay systems stopped
[Green] Character data saved
[Green] Database disconnected
[Yellow] AIChat module stopped

[Red] Characters Plugin error during run 'deleteCharac

DebuggerCore	--- Orchestrates plugins, manages lifecycle and commands
DebuggerPlugin	--- Defines plugin contract (API)
Plugins	--- Implement feature logic, handle commands selectively
DebuggerAssist --- Optional helper layer for monitoring and utilities

==============================================
If you are adding new features or plugins:

==============================================

Create a new module file extending DebuggerPlugin

Fully implement init/run/stop and incorporate error handling

Register the plugin with core.register() in main orchestrator

Use commands intelligently to separate responsibilities

Log statuses and errors clearly as per standard color coding

This structure allows seamless addition, removal, or replacement of plugins with minimal friction.
